## WHAT IS StratoCostaud

**StratoCostaud** is a set of R scripts aimed at detecting the coherent structures as updraft, downdraft and entrainment in Large Eddy Simulations (LES) data. To be used, you will need the two boundary layer and free tropospheric passive scalars as described in Davini et al. (2017)

In the hazardous case you decide to use these scripts please cite:
